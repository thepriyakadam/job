<p>The Taj Mahal is widely recognized as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and   
one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded  
 by many as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a style that combines elements  
 from Islamic, Persian, Ottoman, Turkish and Indian architectural styles.</p>
